## Start with the trust model

Blockchains are useful when you need:

- Shared state between parties that don’t fully trust each other
- Transparent verification of transactions and rules
- Programmable settlement with strong auditability

If a trusted database plus signatures solves the problem, that may be simpler and safer.

## Smart contracts are immutable programs with money attached

The main engineering difference is blast radius:

- Bugs are public and often irreversible
- Upgrades require explicit mechanisms and governance
- “Admin keys” create new trust assumptions

Design for minimal privileges and clear upgrade paths.

Example (explicit access control via a proven library):

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract Vault is Ownable {
    function sweep(address token, address to) external onlyOwner {
        // transfer logic
    }
}
```

## Common vulnerabilities to defend against

Security work is the project:

- Re-entrancy and unsafe external calls
- Integer and precision mistakes
- Access-control gaps and role confusion
- Oracle manipulation and price feed assumptions

Use proven libraries, keep contracts small, and write invariants you can test.

## DApps: most complexity is off-chain

User experience and safety depend on:

- Key management and recovery choices
- Transaction simulation and clear signing prompts
- Monitoring for stuck transactions and chain reorganizations

Assume users will make mistakes and build guardrails accordingly.

## Audits are necessary but not sufficient

High-signal practices:

- Threat modeling and explicit assumptions
- Automated analysis and fuzzing
- Staged rollouts and circuit breakers where possible

Treat security as continuous work, not a final checkbox.
