## Choose based on constraints, not ideology

Both Flutter and React Native can work well. Your choice often comes down to:

- Team skills and existing code (Dart vs TypeScript/JS)
- UI complexity and custom animations
- Need for platform-specific APIs and native modules
- Performance tolerance for heavy lists and transitions

## Flutter: strong UI control, consistent rendering

Flutter shines when you want:

- Pixel-consistent UI across platforms
- Great tooling and integrated widget model
- Fewer surprises from platform view differences

The tradeoff is learning Dart and managing plugin quality.

## React Native: leverage the web ecosystem

React Native is attractive when you:

- Already have React expertise
- Want shared business logic with a web app
- Need rapid iteration with a strong JS toolchain

The tradeoff is that native module boundaries can become a bottleneck if not managed carefully.

## Delivery pitfalls to avoid

Cross-platform projects fail for predictable reasons:

- Underestimating offline states and flaky networks
- Letting “shared code” become tangled coupling
- Shipping without telemetry (crash reports, app startup, navigation latency)

Define a clear module boundary: shared domain logic vs platform UI and platform services.

Example (React Native list perf: stable keys and lightweight rows):

```tsx
<FlatList
  data={items}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Row item={item} /> }
/>
```

## Build for reliability

Make the app resilient:

- Cache critical data and handle refresh safely
- Add retry logic with user-visible progress
- Use feature flags to reduce release risk

Treat release automation (build signing, store metadata, rollout controls) as first-class engineering.
