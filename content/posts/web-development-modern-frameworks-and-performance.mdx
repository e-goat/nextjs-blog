## Pick a framework for the team, not the trend

React, Next.js, and Svelte can all ship great experiences. A better question is:

- Can the team debug it quickly?
- Does it support your rendering needs (SSR, SSG, streaming)?
- Is the ecosystem stable for your dependencies?

## Performance basics that compound

Most wins are not exotic:

- Reduce JavaScript shipped to the browser
- Prefer server rendering for content pages
- Cache aggressively at the edge when possible
- Load images correctly (sizes, formats, lazy loading)

Treat the network as slow and the main thread as expensive.

Example (opt into framework primitives for images):

```tsx
import Image from "next/image"

export function Avatar() {
  return <Image src="/profile-rbd.jpg" alt="Profile photo" width={96} height={96} />
}
```

## A practical rendering checklist

When a page feels slow, look for:

- Too much work during hydration
- Components re-rendering unnecessarily
- Large client-side bundles pulled in by one import
- Long task spikes from third-party scripts

Measure with Web Vitals and ship changes that move a metric, not just code.

## Make accessibility the default

Accessible pages tend to be more robust:

- Semantic HTML first
- Keyboard navigation and visible focus states
- Respect reduced-motion preferences
- Meaningful form labels and errors

It’s easier to build accessible components than to retrofit them.

## Treat the UI as a system

Consistency reduces bugs:

- Shared primitives (buttons, inputs, dialog patterns)
- A small design token set (spacing, color, typography)
- Linting and CI checks to keep regressions out
