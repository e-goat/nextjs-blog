## Docker: standardize packaging, not architecture

Containers are a delivery primitive:

- Build reproducible images
- Keep images small and explicit
- Run as non-root where possible

Treat the Dockerfile as part of your supply chain, not a one-off script.

## Kubernetes: adopt it for operational leverage

Kubernetes is worth it when you need:

- Multiple services with shared scheduling and scaling needs
- Strong isolation between workloads
- A consistent deployment and networking model

If you’re running one or two services, a managed container platform may be simpler.

## The basics that keep clusters stable

Stable clusters come from discipline:

- Requests/limits so scheduling is predictable
- Readiness/liveness probes that reflect reality
- Pod disruption budgets for safe upgrades
- Resource-aware autoscaling

Example (declare requests/limits and a basic readiness probe):

```yml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "100m"
    memory: "128Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "512Mi"
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 8080
```

## Service mesh: earn it

A mesh can help with:

- Mutual TLS between services
- Fine-grained traffic control (canary, retries, timeouts)
- Uniform telemetry

It also adds complexity and failure modes. Adopt it when you have a real need for consistent security and traffic policy across many services.

## Keep the platform observable

Prioritize:

- Cluster-level metrics (CPU/memory pressure, eviction rates)
- Workload health (restarts, readiness)
- Traces across ingress and service boundaries

If debugging requires guesswork, you’ll pay for it in incidents.
