## Secure coding starts with defaults

The safest code is the code you don’t have to remember to secure:

- Validate inputs at boundaries (API, jobs, webhooks)
- Encode outputs based on context (HTML, SQL, shell)
- Use parameterized queries and safe serializers
- Centralize auth and authorization checks

Treat “security bugs” as logic bugs that happen to have higher impact.

Example (parameterized queries avoid injection):

```ts
await db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1", [userId])
```

## Zero trust is identity and verification, everywhere

Zero trust is not a product. It’s a pattern:

- Authenticate every request (service-to-service included)
- Authorize with least privilege and strong segmentation
- Assume the network is hostile and credentials can leak

Focus on reducing blast radius: separate data, separate roles, separate environments.

## Threat modeling: keep it lightweight and continuous

You don’t need a long workshop to get value. For each feature, answer:

- What are we protecting (data, money movement, admin actions)?
- Who might attack (curious user, competitor, insider, bot)?
- Where are the trust boundaries (browser to API, API to DB, third parties)?
- What’s the worst realistic failure?

## Controls that pay off quickly

High leverage practices:

- Dependency scanning and upgrade automation
- Secret detection in CI
- Security headers and CSP where applicable
- Rate limiting and abuse detection for public endpoints

## Incident readiness is part of security

Assume you will have incidents. Prepare:

- Structured logs with enough context to investigate
- Runbooks for common issues (credential leak, suspicious auth)
- A clear on-call and escalation path
